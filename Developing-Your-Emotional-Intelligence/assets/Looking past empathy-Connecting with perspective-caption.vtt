00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.824
Empathy is often seen as a key part of emotional intelligence
—but what if it doesn’t come easily to you?

00:00:06.324 --> 00:00:08.626
Some people find empathy overwhelming.

00:00:08.626 --> 00:00:13.230
Others may struggle with it entirely, especially
those who are neurodivergent.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:14.878
And that’s okay.

00:00:15.078 --> 00:00:20.428
Instead of focusing only on empathy, try shifting your focus to
understanding perspectives.

00:00:20.928 --> 00:00:23.421
There’s a subtle but powerful difference.

00:00:23.421 --> 00:00:30.694
Understanding perspective means you respect and consider someone
else’s viewpoint—without having to feel what they feel.

00:00:31.194 --> 00:00:34.434
This might look like reflecting on what you already know about

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:38.920
someone before a meeting, or imagining how they might experience a
shared situation.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.960
You're not trying to guess their exact feelings—you're simply opening
up to the possibility of what they might be thinking or feeling.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.511
Here are a couple of tips:

00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:54.857
- Before a conversation, set an intention: “I want
to understand their point of view.”

00:00:54.857 --> 00:00:58.227
- During the conversation, ask thoughtful questions like:

00:00:58.227 --> 00:01:00.552
- “Tell me more about where you’re coming from.”

00:01:00.726 --> 00:01:01.161
- Or “What am I missing here?”

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:04.888
This approach has two major benefits:

00:01:04.888 --> 00:01:10.583
First, it helps you understand the other person’s goals and
values—which makes finding solutions easier.

00:01:11.283 --> 00:01:12.923
Second, it helps build trust.

00:01:13.123 --> 00:01:15.949
People appreciate feeling heard, even if you don’t
fully agree with them.

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.533
So here’s your challenge:

00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:22.681
In the coming weeks, make an effort to see things
from others’ perspectives.

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:24.532
You may be surprised at the outcome.
