To build emotional intelligence, you need to develop both
self-awareness and social awareness.

00:00:05.548 --> 00:00:08.503
Self-awareness helps you understand your own emotions.

00:00:08.503 --> 00:00:12.812
Social awareness is about using that understanding
to connect better with others.

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:14.558
A great way to start?

00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.320
Use your senses.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.798
When you're in a conversation or walking through your environment,
pause and ask yourself:

00:00:23.998 --> 00:00:24.930
-	"What do I see?"

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.367
-	"What do I hear?"

00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:27.751
-	"What do I feel?"

00:00:27.951 --> 00:00:34.000
It might sound simple, but we often miss these cues—especially when
we’re stressed or busy.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.264
Try a quick “sensory audit.” Go for a walk and
really focus on your surroundings.

00:00:39.264 --> 00:00:47.828
The more you practice, the more aware you'll become of social
signals—like facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language.

00:00:47.828 --> 00:00:52.227
These small details can tell you a lot about how others are feeling.

00:00:52.227 --> 00:00:59.141
When you tune in, you can respond more thoughtfully and build
stronger, more meaningful relationships.

00:00:59.141 --> 00:01:02.380
