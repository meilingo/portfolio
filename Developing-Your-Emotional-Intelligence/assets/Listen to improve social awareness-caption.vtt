00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.810
When we think about effective communication, we often focus on how to
get our point across, and how others will interpret our message.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.462
But that's only half of the story.

00:00:10.662 --> 00:00:15.543
Communication isn't just about giving
information—it's also about gathering it.

00:00:15.543 --> 00:00:18.662
The key to effective communication is listening.

00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:23.172
Yes, you’ll have a message to share, but to truly build strong and

00:00:23.172 --> 00:00:31.044
meaningful relationships, you need to listen—not just to the words,
but also to the tone and body language of the other person.

00:00:32.444 --> 00:00:38.496
It’s easy to focus only on your point, especially when emotions run
high or you're under pressure.

00:00:38.696 --> 00:00:41.262
But that’s a missed opportunity.

00:00:41.462 --> 00:00:45.521
When you REALLY listen to the other person’s message, you're more

00:00:45.521 --> 00:00:51.278
likely to find common ground, work together, and even discover new
solutions to challenges.

00:00:51.778 --> 00:00:58.508
At times, our emotions can hijack our thoughts, making us feel like
we must speak our truth immediately.

00:00:58.508 --> 00:01:04.310
But if your goal is to build strong relationships, speaking out of
emotion might not help.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.249
Instead, take a step back, pause, and listen.

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:10.675
Reflect on your communication style.

00:01:10.875 --> 00:01:12.831
Do you listen attentively?

00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:15.753
Are there moments when you listen more than others?

00:01:15.753 --> 00:01:18.158
What could you do to become a better listener?

00:01:18.158 --> 00:01:24.564
Here’s a practical tip: before meetings, set an intention to learn
something new from the conversation.

00:01:24.564 --> 00:01:32.134
Afterward, take a moment to reflect on what you’ve learned, whether
it's from words, body language, or dynamics in the room.

00:01:32.134 --> 00:01:36.226
By mastering active listening, you'll ensure that communication flows

00:01:36.226 --> 00:01:42.061
equally between you and the other person, creating better
understanding and stronger relationships.

00:01:42.061 --> 00:01:45.145
Remember, it all starts with listening before speaking.

00:01:45.145 --> 00:01:49.192
Give it a try, and watch how your relationships and
communication improve.
