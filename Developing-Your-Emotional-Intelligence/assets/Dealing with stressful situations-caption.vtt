00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.708
Acting on emotional impulse means you’re letting your emotions lead
your behavior—which isn’t always a bad thing.

00:00:05.908 --> 00:00:07.820
It depends on the situation.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:14.587
For example, when you’re feeling excited or passionate, that energy
can draw others in and help you connect.

00:00:14.587 --> 00:00:18.051
It’s a great way to engage with people in a meaningful way.

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:21.669
But being driven by strong emotions like anger or fear?

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:24.973
That can lead to reactions you might later regret.

00:00:24.973 --> 00:00:32.537
The tricky part is, the time between having a thought, feeling an
emotion, and reacting can be incredibly FAST.

00:00:32.537 --> 00:00:36.116
So fast, it might not even feel like there is a choice.

00:00:36.116 --> 00:00:41.728
But there is—and with practice, you can create that
space to choose how to respond.

00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:44.024
So how do you do it?

00:00:45.218 --> 00:00:49.569
Step one: Start by noticing when you’re reacting emotionally.

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:53.099
Ask yourself, “Could I be more objective right now?

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:55.562
” That awareness is the first shift.

00:00:55.562 --> 00:01:01.224
Step two: When you feel intense emotions—like
anger, frustration, or fear—pause.

00:01:01.424 --> 00:01:03.866
Take a step back and breathe.

00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:08.919
Unless you're in an urgent or crisis situation, you
probably have time.

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.480
Even a few minutes can help.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.845
Take slow, deep breaths.

00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:17.185
This simple action can regulate your body’s physical

00:01:17.185 --> 00:01:22.349
response—lowering your heart rate, reducing
tension, and helping you regain control.

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:26.780
Step three: Give yourself space to recover.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.384
Let your body calm down before making any decisions.

00:01:30.568 --> 00:01:31.028
This recovery phase is key.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.867
Step four: Once you’ve had that time, you can
assess the situation more clearly.

00:01:37.067 --> 00:01:39.066
Now, decide how to respond.

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:45.594
You might still choose the same course of action you were leaning
toward before—but now, you’ve made that decision with clarity.

00:01:45.794 --> 00:01:46.939
Not impulse.

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.687
The truth is, breaking the link between emotion
and reaction takes effort.

00:01:53.687 --> 00:01:56.860
It’s even harder when you’re tired or overwhelmed.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.139
But when you feel those emotional shifts happening—if you can pause,

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:06.746
breathe, and give yourself just a little time—you’ll set yourself up
for a better outcome.

00:02:06.746 --> 00:02:08.966
Not just for you, but for everyone involved.
