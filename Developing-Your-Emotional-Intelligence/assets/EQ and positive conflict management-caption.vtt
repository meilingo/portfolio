00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.027
It’s easy to think that a workplace without conflict is a peaceful

00:00:04.027 --> 00:00:10.033
and productive environment, but the truth is, healthy conflict can be
a powerful tool for growth.

00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:17.356
When managed well, conflict sparks debates, encourages alternative
perspectives, and pushes teams to achieve more.

00:00:18.756 --> 00:00:23.726
Creating a culture where people can respectfully
challenge ideas and opinions is key.

00:00:23.726 --> 00:00:26.654
And this is where emotional intelligence comes in.

00:00:26.654 --> 00:00:31.896
By using EQ, you can transform conflict into a positive experience
that benefits everyone.

00:00:31.896 --> 00:00:34.612
Start by agreeing on the rules of engagement.

00:00:34.612 --> 00:00:37.828
Discuss what healthy debate looks like for your team.

00:00:37.828 --> 00:00:43.974
Even if you're not leading the team, you can still take the
initiative and help create a team manifesto.

00:00:43.974 --> 00:00:50.835
For example, decide together how you’ll voice opinions and ensure
that everyone’s views are heard and respected.

00:00:50.835 --> 00:00:53.947
Set guidelines for respectful disagreement.

00:00:53.947 --> 00:01:00.013
Make sure everyone knows that the focus is on challenging ideas, not
attacking the person.

00:01:00.013 --> 00:01:06.796
This helps minimize defensiveness and creates a supportive
environment where everyone can thrive.

00:01:06.796 --> 00:01:15.309
Another key strategy is practicing “plussing.” This means that when
you challenge an idea, you add a constructive suggestion.

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:21.674
For example, instead of saying “Yes, but,” try saying “Yes, and” to
build on the idea

00:01:21.874 --> 00:01:24.443
or “What if?” to suggest a new perspective.

00:01:24.643 --> 00:01:29.496
This approach fosters a culture of thoughtful, constructive feedback.

00:01:29.496 --> 00:01:33.901
Remember, disagreement isn’t bad—it’s how we handle it that matters.

00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:40.470
When done right, conflict can strengthen relationships, build trust,
and improve team collaboration.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.293
Use emotional intelligence to turn conflict into a powerful tool for
connection and growth.
