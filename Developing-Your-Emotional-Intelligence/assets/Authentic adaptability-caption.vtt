00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.694
Want to build stronger relationships at work?

00:00:02.694 --> 00:00:07.184
Start by using your communication strengths—and
staying true to who you are.

00:00:07.184 --> 00:00:09.667
When you’re genuine, people feel it.

00:00:09.667 --> 00:00:15.755
You create trust—and that trust becomes the foundation for great
working relationships.

00:00:15.755 --> 00:00:21.041
But here’s the thing—being yourself doesn’t mean
using one style all the time.

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:24.085
Communication also requires adaptability.

00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:27.443
Flexing your style doesn’t mean changing who you are.

00:00:27.443 --> 00:00:31.697
It just means showing different sides of yourself,
depending on the situation.

00:00:33.297 --> 00:00:34.783
So, where do you begin?

00:00:35.183 --> 00:00:36.565
First—look inward.

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:38.530
What are your communication strengths?

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.748
Maybe you’re a great listener.

00:00:40.948 --> 00:00:43.399
Maybe you make others feel heard and comfortable.

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.785
Maybe you’re skilled at reading the room—or connecting one-on-one.

00:00:46.785 --> 00:00:49.372
If you’re not sure, ask someone you trust.

00:00:49.372 --> 00:00:53.734
We often overlook our own strengths because they come naturally to us.

00:00:54.434 --> 00:00:56.844
Now, think about how you adapt.

00:00:57.044 --> 00:01:02.185
Do you change your tone when talking to someone
who’s high energy—or more reserved?

00:01:02.185 --> 00:01:09.016
Can you share a story or adjust your approach based on what they
need—facts, empathy, or big-picture thinking?

00:01:09.016 --> 00:01:12.275
Before your next conversation, pause and reflect.

00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:15.382
How can your strengths support the interaction?

00:01:15.382 --> 00:01:22.051
Being mindful—and flexible—helps you connect with others in a way
that’s both effective and authentic.
