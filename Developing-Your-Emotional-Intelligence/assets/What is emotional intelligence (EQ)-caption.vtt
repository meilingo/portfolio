00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.139
In today’s fast-paced and ever-changing work environment, emotional

00:00:05.139 --> 00:00:14.219
intelligence (EQ) is more than just a valuable skill—it’s a defining
trait of high performers and successful professionals.

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.129
Unlike IQ or personality traits, EQ isn’t fixed; it can be
strengthened over time.

00:00:21.729 --> 00:00:23.190
Want to reduce stress or anxiety?

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:24.673
Strengthen your EQ.

00:00:24.873 --> 00:00:27.010
Facing challenges or adapting to change?

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.297
EQ makes the process smoother.

00:00:29.497 --> 00:00:33.126
Looking for a promotion and hoping to build strong
relationships with key stakeholders?

00:00:33.326 --> 00:00:34.455
You guessed it.

00:00:34.855 --> 00:00:35.984
Work on your EQ.

00:00:36.184 --> 00:00:39.136
Emotional intelligence is built on four core skills:

00:00:39.336 --> 00:00:39.953
1.

00:00:40.153 --> 00:00:43.080
Self-awareness – Recognizing your emotions and triggers.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.900
2.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.103
Self-management – Controlling your emotional responses.

00:00:47.303 --> 00:00:47.910
3.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.544
Social awareness – Understanding the emotions and
perspectives of others.

00:00:51.744 --> 00:00:52.378
4.

00:00:52.578 --> 00:00:56.586
Relationship management – Building strong and positive connections.

00:00:56.586 --> 00:01:01.480
The first two focus on personal competence, and the last two focus on
social competence.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.040
The great news?

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.878
