00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.093
Understanding emotional intelligence is one thing, but taking action

00:00:04.093 --> 00:00:08.186
to develop it is key to achieving your personal and
professional goals.

00:00:08.186 --> 00:00:11.938
That’s why you need an emotional intelligence development plan.

00:00:12.138 --> 00:00:14.638
Start by considering your vision.

00:00:15.038 --> 00:00:17.125
What do you want to achieve?

00:00:17.325 --> 00:00:22.153
Maybe it's building strong relationships or
improving your emotional awareness.

00:00:22.153 --> 00:00:25.809
Complete this statement: 'The one thing I'd like to work on is…'

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.131
Next—think about your mission.

00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:30.414
Why does this matter to you?

00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:34.159
Is it for a promotion, better work relationships, or personal growth?

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:36.241
Dig deep into your reasons.

00:00:36.641 --> 00:00:38.554
Then, set clear goals.

00:00:38.754 --> 00:00:43.067
Whether it’s meeting with a mentor, journaling daily, or practicing

00:00:43.067 --> 00:00:47.752
mindfulness in tense moments, write down exactly
what you want to achieve.

00:00:47.752 --> 00:00:52.026
Now, list the tactics to reach those goals—how will you get there?

00:00:52.026 --> 00:00:54.436
And finally, measure your progress.

00:00:54.436 --> 00:00:57.078
How will you know when you've succeeded?

00:00:57.078 --> 00:01:01.520
Developing emotional intelligence takes commitment, but it’s worth it.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.109
With a plan in hand, you’ll be on your way to achieving your goals
and creating lasting change.

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:11.707
So, take the first step today—your future self will thank you.
