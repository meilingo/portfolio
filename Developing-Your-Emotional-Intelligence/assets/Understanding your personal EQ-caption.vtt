00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.162
Emotions are complex.

00:00:02.362 --> 00:00:06.978
They shape how we interpret the world and influence
the actions we take.

00:00:06.978 --> 00:00:13.825
When we talk about emotions, we’re referring to the way our brain
explains how we feel in a given situation.

00:00:13.825 --> 00:00:19.902
These feelings can be mild or intense, pleasant or unpleasant—but
they always feel real to us.

00:00:19.902 --> 00:00:22.903
Each of us experiences emotions differently.

00:00:22.903 --> 00:00:28.673
In the same situation, you might feel frustrated, while someone else
feels indifferent.

00:00:28.673 --> 00:00:31.519
Even within ourselves, reactions can vary.

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:39.520
Think about a time when something upset you deeply, yet on another
day, the same situation might not have bothered you at all.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.690
Our emotions don’t just exist in our minds—they can trigger
physical responses.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.719
A racing heart, tense muscles, or butterflies in your stomach.

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:56.105
These physical sensations, paired with emotions like fear or
excitement, influence how we behave.

00:00:56.105 --> 00:01:01.503
Recognizing this connection is the first step to
building emotional intelligence.

00:01:03.403 --> 00:01:06.673
So how can you build awareness of your emotions?

00:01:06.673 --> 00:01:11.088
Try this: The next time you face a challenging situation at work,

00:01:11.088 --> 00:01:18.446
schedule a moment to reflect—later that day, at the end of the week,
or whenever your emotions have settled.

00:01:18.646 --> 00:01:19.683
ASK yourself:

00:01:20.083 --> 00:01:21.538
-	How did I feel in that moment?

00:01:21.938 --> 00:01:23.027
-	Why did I feel that way?

00:01:23.227 --> 00:01:29.078
-	Was it the situation itself or something deeper, like an insecurity
or past experience?

00:01:29.078 --> 00:01:30.865
-	Do I notice any patterns in my reactions?

00:01:32.265 --> 00:01:39.041
Remember, emotional intelligence isn’t about changing who you
are—it’s about understanding yourself.

00:01:39.041 --> 00:01:44.980
Over time, this awareness may shift how you respond in challenging
situations… or it may not.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:52.442
Either way, the insight you gain will strengthen your
self-awareness—key to both success and personal well-being.

00:01:54.342 --> 00:02:00.452
Emotions shape our experiences, but with awareness, we can shape
how we navigate them.

00:02:00.452 --> 00:02:04.470
Take the time to reflect—it’s an investment in yourself.
