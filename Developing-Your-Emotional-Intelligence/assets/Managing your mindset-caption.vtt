00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.336
Right now, as you're listening, your brain is juggling a lot—maybe

00:00:04.336 --> 00:00:12.419
emails are popping up, people are talking nearby, or you’re dealing
with physical distractions like being too hot, cold, or uncomfortable.

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:16.117
You might also have a hundred thoughts racing through your mind.

00:00:16.117 --> 00:00:21.279
Even if you’re used to it, your brain is working
hard to process all that information.

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:27.821
To keep up, it uses cognitive or mental shortcuts to focus on what
seems important and make quick decisions.

00:00:27.821 --> 00:00:30.437
This helps you avoid feeling overwhelmed.

00:00:30.437 --> 00:00:37.706
But sometimes, those shortcuts can be wrong or lazy—causing you to
fall into the same emotional patterns over and over.

00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:42.763
These patterns are often triggered by certain situations or

00:00:42.763 --> 00:00:49.646
people—like being late, speaking in public, or interacting with
someone who makes you feel unsure or frustrated.

00:00:49.646 --> 00:00:55.955
Emotional triggers can lead to negative thoughts and unhelpful
reactions, all happening in an instant.

00:00:56.155 --> 00:00:57.789
Take a moment to reflect.

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.796
Think about challenges you’ve faced over the last six months.

00:01:00.796 --> 00:01:03.010
Do the same thoughts or feelings keep showing up?

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.897
Can you spot any patterns?

00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:07.372
Now dig a little deeper.

00:01:07.572 --> 00:01:12.059
How have those emotions or thought patterns affected how you react?

00:01:12.059 --> 00:01:16.388
Maybe you shut down, get angry, feel stressed, or become defiant.

00:01:16.388 --> 00:01:21.425
Whatever your reaction, you probably know it’s not
always the most helpful.

00:01:21.425 --> 00:01:24.612
Recognizing these emotional triggers is key to building

00:01:24.612 --> 00:01:30.986
self-awareness—and that’s the first step toward managing your mindset
and responding in a more intentional way.
